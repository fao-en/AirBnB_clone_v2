0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL
task 2:
Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
Value syntax:
String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
Integer: <number> => default case
If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped

task 3:
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_dev_db
A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail

task 4:
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_test_db
A new user hbnb_test (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_test should be set to hbnb_test_pwd
hbnb_test should have all privileges on the database hbnb_test_db (and only this database)
hbnb_test should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_test_db or the user hbnb_test already exists, your script should not fail

task 5:
Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a new public instance method: def delete(self, obj=None): to delete obj from __objects if it’s inside - if obj is equal to None, the method should not do anything
Update the prototype of def all(self) to def all(self, cls=None) - that returns the list of objects of one type of class. Example below with State - it’s an optional filtering

task 7:
Update User: (models/user.py)

User inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class User:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, users
class attribute email
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute password
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute first_name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can be null
class attribute last_name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can be null
